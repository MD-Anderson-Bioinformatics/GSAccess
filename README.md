The goal of the Gene Survey project is to take TCGA Standardized Data and make gene level cross-disease and sometimes cross platform comparisons and evaluations simpler to perform, as these represent common questions asked of PIs and analysts. That is, a common question is: how does gene XYZ act across disease types?

This is a Java application used for this project. The GAAccess application provides a Java link between the data and the R package most of our users use for statistical analysis.

GSAccess is a Netbeans project. 

Once compiled, all the JAR files go into the inst/GSAccess directory in the GeneSurvey package. (That package already has copies of these JARs.)
